# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Ophicleide Word2vec application.
Ophicleide is a cloud native application that provides users with an easy path
to train and query [Word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) models
from their web browser.

Ophicleide can ingest text corpora from any URL it can reach through HTTP/S
protocols. Word2vec models are then trained from these texts, with the end
result being an interface to make single word queries against the models to
find other words in the corpora with similar vectors.
